model.json files contain data that drives model.js models.

There's a generic model.js which knows some basic rules, but you
can also extend it to produce models with extra rules.

Anything that gets written into a model's result object will be serialized
and saved. As part of this, if a model.json uses:

rules: {
  "foo": "SomeModel(bar)"
}

then:
  (1) bar will be fed into SomeModel; and
  (2) the outer model will track SomeModel's results object for serialization
      purposes.
